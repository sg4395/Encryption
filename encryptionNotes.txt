Lv1 : check password and email against stored.

Lv2: lv1 but password is now encrypted. But if we deploy our website and git repo, then people can see our encryption method of secret key.

Use mongoose-encryption:
 Const secret= "randomString"
xxxxxxSchema.plugin(encrypt,{secret:secret, encryptedFields: ['field1, field2'] });
Plug in is before creating collection using Schema. Plugin enriches schema function.

Lv3: use dotenv to add environment variable to store sensitive info.
require('dotenv'),config(); no need for const. Because we don't need to call it back, only need it up and running right at the start.
touch .env in your root directory. This is a hidden file.
Add environment variables in the form of NAME=value.

To fetch it back out into .js use process.env.NAME
Use gitignore to include .env file.
